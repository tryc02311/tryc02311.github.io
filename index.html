                    it all began. You will pass through 12 beautiful states, covering a total of 3,600 miles, and accomplish 
                    3 monumental missions. Partying and taking a selfie with a famous rock star, donating $1 to a billionaire 
                    to help eradicate polio in Africa, and even stopping by famous author Stephen King's house to say hi and 
                    asking him to sign your favorite book.</p>

                        this is an extraordinary and highly underrated state full of rich history and 
                        majestic natural beauty. Maine is the main state you want to be sure not to 
                        miss. As your journey is going to be a long one, you had best be prepared for 
                        an arduous trek.</p>
                        <p class="place__paragraph">Thankfully, not only is Maine home to the very first 
                        European settlers on US territory in the era of Vikings, but is also home to 
                        L.L. Bean, which is a great company to grab a super sturdy backpack from for 
                        your 3-month expedition.</p>

                        in nature than in springtime New Hampshire. As serene and beautiful as it 
                        was in the 1700s, this state is still much less traveled than its neighbors
                        to the South. So enjoy it while it lasts.</p>
                        <p class="place__paragraph">You won't be on your bike the whole time, 
                        so doesn't it make sense to pick up some extra footwear? Fortunately for you, 
                        the best outdoor shoe company in the history of the world proudly hails from 
                        this state. Cycle by the Timberland headquarters in Stratham, and pick up a 
                        pair of rugged, waterproof boots to keep your feet dry. Fitting for unpredictable 
                        weather you may be confronted by while passing through the Appalachians. These 
                        boots are also better than cycling shoes when pitching a tent.</p>

                        the state of NY also has several other reasons for going down 
                        in history. Since the late 1800s Schenectady, “The City that 
                        Lights and Hauls the World,” has been home to the world-famous 
                        General Electric Company.</p>

                        So we figured this would be the perfect place to find a batteryless 
                        dynamo light for your bicycle to help you see through those dark 
                        lonely roads on your adventure. Such a light from GE will set you

                        time to time, is another town worth passing through for 
                        several different reasons. While it might be most famously 
                        known as the scene of the Gettysburg address delivered by 
                        Mr. Lincoln during the Civil war, Pennsylvania also has 
                        produced a rather decent-sized Amish community (eerie, huh?)</p>
                        <p class="place__paragraph">The reason we've brought you here today, 
                        if you haven't already guessed, can be summed up by using one 
                        delicious word: chocolate. Hershey's is a Pennsylvania-based company. 
                        Most likely, one of the tastiest missions you'll ever embark on during 
                        this tour, try to find an Amish friend and enjoy a bar in the National 
                        Wildlife Refuge on your way to Erie and have an extra eerie time!</p>
                        <p class="place__paragraph">The current cost of a Hershey's Chocolate bar: about 60¢.</p>
